                I am currently a <a href="#experience">Lecturer at UCL</a> in the Integrated Machine Learning
                Systems Master's programme.
                Previously, I completed a PhD at UCL under the supervision of
                <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/55855-laura-toni">Laura Toni</a> and
                <a href="https://rockt.ai">Tim Rocktäschel</a> in the Learning and Signal Processing (LASP)
                group.
                Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London with
                <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.bharath">Anil Bharath</a>, and served as
                <a href="https://www.burohappold.com/specialisms/computational-engineering/">Machine Learning
                    Lead</a> at BuroHappold Engineering.

                My research is at the intersection of <a href="#publications">Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>
                and
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12798">Large Language Models</a>, with a focus on the
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01072">Credit Assignment Problem</a>.
                I am particularly interested in how AI evaluates actions, and in scaling reinforcement learning
                to
                enable
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04268">open-ended learning</a> and real-world
                generalisation.
