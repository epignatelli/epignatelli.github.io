                    I currently act as a <b>Lecturer at UCL</b>, for the Integrated Machine Learning Systems master
                    course.
                    Previously, I was a PhD student at UCL with <b>Dr Laura Toni</b> and <b>Dr Tim Rocktäschel</b> in
                    the <a href="https://laspucl2016.com">Learning and Signal Processing (LASP)</a> group.
                    Before that, I was a postdoc at the <a href="http://www.bici-lab.org/team/">Biologically-Inspired
                        Computation and Inference Lab (BICI)</a> at the <b>Imperial College</b>, and the <b>Machine
                        Learning Lead</b> at <ahref="https:
