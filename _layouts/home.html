                    I started my professional journey five years ago between industry and academia. Thenceforth, I researched.
                    My activity progressively shifted from design towards computer science,
                    reinforcing my passion and interest in Artificial General Intelligence.

                    In <b>2020</b> I joined the LASP group at UCL as a PhD student
                    to consolidate the transition to AI and conduct research on Continual Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

                <span>
                    In <b>2019</b> I joined the BICI group at the Imperial College as a postdoc
                    to study the applications of deep learning to solve differential equations in physics.

                <span>
                    At Burohappold Engineeering, in <b>2017</b>, I specialised in machine learning,
                    and lead the applied research group in Machine Learning and Decision Making in <b>2018</b>.

                <span>
                    In <b>2014</b>, at Gridshell.it, I conducted research on generative design and
                    multi-objective optimisation using genetic algorithms.

                <span>
                    I hold a bachelor and a M.sc. in Architecture at the University of Naples, awarded in <b>2015</b>,
                    where I studied the role of human perception and the process of creative creation in design.

                        I used deep learning to infer approximate solutions in about 1% of time necessary to canonical methods
