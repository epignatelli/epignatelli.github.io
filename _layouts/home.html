                I started my professional journey five years ago between industry and academia. <span class="emphasize">Thenceforth, I researched</span>.
                My activity progressively shifted from design towards computer science, reinforcing my passion and interest in Artificial General Intelligence.
                Investigating and understanding the psyche is the <span class="emphasize">rest</span> of my life.
                This rest turned out to coherently merge with my profession, my passion and has become my mission.
                My interests are in <span class="emphasize">artificial general intelligence</span> and <span class="emphasize">autonomous learning</span>,
                and include <span class="emphasize">deep learning, reinforcement learning, multiagent systems</span>, game theory and computer vision.

                        with a <b>postdoc</b> position funded by the Rosetrees Trust.
                        I conducted research to shorten the computational time for predictive modelling of
                        surgical interventions in cardiology, by exploring the use of deep learning to create surrogate models.
                        I used <b>deep learning</b> to infer approximate solutions in about 1% of time necessary to standard models
                        The project is a multidisciplinary initiative that brings together the National Heart and Lung Institute,
                        and the Departments of Bioengineering, Aeronautics, Computing and Physics to address key challenges
                        in the diagnosis and treatment of complex cardiac arrhythmias.

                        to help understand how AI can create value for the business. He is pursuing the democratisation of the access
