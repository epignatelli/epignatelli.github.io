                    I started my professional journey five years ago between industry and academia. Thenceforth, I researched.
                    My activity progressively shifted from design towards computer science,
                    reinforcing my passion and interest in Artificial General Intelligence.

                    In <b>2020</b> I joined the LASP group at UCL as a PhD student
                    to consolidate the transition to AI and conduct research on Continual Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

                    In <b>2019</b> I joined the BICI group at the Imperial College as a postdoc
                    to study the applications of deep learning to solve differential equations in physics.

                <span>
                    At Burohappold Engineeering, in <b>2017</b>, I specialised in machine learning,
                    and lead the applied research group in Machine Learning and Decision Making in <b>2018</b>.
                </span>
                <span>
                    In <b>2015</b>, at Gridshell.it, I conducted research on generative design and
                    multi-objective optimisation using genetic algorithms.
                </span>
                <span>
                    I was awarded a bachelor and a M.sc. in Architecture at the University of Naples in <b>2015</b>,
                    where I studied the role of human perception and the process of creative creation in design.

                    <b>Today</b>, my research interests are in artificial general intelligence and autonomous learning,
                    and include deep learning, reinforcement learning, multiagent systems, game theory and computer vision.

                        In <b>2019</b> I joined the <b>Biologically-Inspired Computation and Inference Lab</b> (BICI) at the <b>Imperial College</b>
                        with a <b>postdoc</b> position funded by the Rosetrees Trust.
                        I conducted research to shorten the computational time for predictive modelling of
                        surgical interventions in cardiology, by exploring the use of deep learning to create surrogate models.
                        I used <b>deep learning</b> to infer approximate solutions in about 1% of time necessary to standard models
                        The project is a multidisciplinary initiative that brings together the National Heart and Lung Institute,
                        and the Departments of Bioengineering, Aeronautics, Computing and Physics to address key challenges
                        in the diagnosis and treatment of complex cardiac arrhythmias.

                        to help understand how AI can create value for the business. I worked to democratise the access
                        to Deep Learning technologies to allow every employee to access the knowledge and the tools. I used Visual Programming,
                        a recognised and diffused tool for design, to create a framework that interoperates between the most common deep learning libraries,
                        tensorflow, keras, pytorch, numpy.
