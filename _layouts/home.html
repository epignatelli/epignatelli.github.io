                I am an architect by training, a computer scientist by profession.
                Investigating and understanding the psyche - and my psyche - is the <b>rest</b> of my life.
                This rest turned out to coherently merge with my profession, my passion and has become my mission.
                My interests are in <b>artificial general intelligence</b> and <b>autonomous learning</b>, and include <b>deep learning, reinforcement learning,
                multi-agent systems</b>, game theory and computer vision.
