                    In 2020 I joined the LASP Group at <b>UCL</b> as a <b>PhD student</b>
                    to consolidate the transition and conduct research on Continual Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

                    In 2019 I joined the <b>Imperial College</b> with a <b>postdoc position</b> to study the applications of deep learning to solve differential equations in physics.
                    My focus was on a better understanding of atrial fibrillation through the development of a surrogate model for the propagation of action potential signal.

                    At <b>Burohappold Engineeering</b>, in 2017, I specialised in machine learning,
                    designed and implemented deep neural networks for video classification with the Premier League.
                    I improved my skills in software architecture, supporting on the framework architecture and
                    designing the user interface of the BHoM - bhom.xyz.

                    In 2015, at Gridshell.it, I conducted research on generative design and multi-objective optimisation using genetic algorithms.
                    The main applications are in physics, for acoustical and structural purposes.

                    I hold a bachelor and a M.sc. in Architecture at the <b>University of Naples</b>,
                    where I studied the role of human perception and the process of creative creation in design.
                </span><br>

                At Gridshell.it, I implemented \textit{numerical methods} for acoustical and structural analyses.
                At BuroHappold Engineering I improved my skills in \textit{software architecture}, supporting on the framework architecture and designing the user interface of the BHoM - bhom.xyz.
                I specialised in \textit{machine learning}, designed and implemented deep neural networks for video classification with the Premier League.

                The understanding of the <b>psyche</b> is my passion, my profession, and has become my mission.
                In <b>2018</b> I applied Deep Learning to learn approximate solutions to differential equations.
                In <b>2017</b> I led the applied research in machine learning at Buro Happold Engineering.
                My research interests are in <span class="emphasize">artificial general intelligence</span> and <span class="emphasize">autonomous learning</span>,
                and include <span class="emphasize">deep learning, reinforcement learning, multiagent systems</span>, game theory and computer vision.

                        I conducted research to shorten the computational time for predictive modelling of
                        surgical interventions in cardiology, by exploring the use of deep learning to create surrogate models.
                        I used <b>deep learning</b> to infer approximate solutions in about 1% of time necessary to standard models
